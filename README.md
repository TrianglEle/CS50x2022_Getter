# CS50x2022_Getter
A python script that downloads all the lectures from the CS50x 2022 course by Harvard University, from week 0 to week 10. (currently works only for windows).

Please note that to use this script, you need to have ffmpeg previously installed. You can install it from their website, https://FFmpeg.org/

To use this script, go to the releases and download the latest .exe file.

Place the .exe file wherever you want to download the course, and run it.

After it is finished, you will find a "Courses" folder, where all the lectures will be downloaded in an mkv format.


All the credits to the lectures go to Harvard University. They are not owned by me, and are there as archives in Harvard University's official website.
